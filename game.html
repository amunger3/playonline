    This page allows to play super master mind / code breaker online.<br>
    The game is assisted by a calculator which will give you hints to find the optimal strategy!<br>
    Several game modes are possible, from 3 (very easy) to 7 columns (expert) and from 6 to 10 colors<br>
    At each stage of the game, the number of remaining possible codes is automatically computed and displayed.<br>
    The calculator also compares what you played to the "optimal mathematical strategy". For each code played,<br>
    it compares "the average number of attempts to find secret codes" which is reachable when an optimal code is played<br>
    to this average number when your code is played, and then displays the difference next to your code. For example:<br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin:0;">
    <li>+0.00 means that what you played was optimal (no difference between your code and the optimal codes),</li>
    <li>-1.00 means that what you played was totally useless (1 attempt was lost, thus -1),</li>
    <li>-0.50 means that what you played was not optimal: you lost 1/2 attempt on average<br> 
    to reach secret codes in comparison to an optimal code. That means that if the optimal strategy reaches<br>
    the secret code in 4 attempts on average, your code (followed by an optimal strategy) will reach it in 4.5 attempts on average.<br>
    Of course, if you are lucky, this inefficient code may be the secret code, in which case you will win instantly the game! :)<br>
    </ul>
    <div id='strategy_details' onclick="document.getElementById('strategy_details').innerHTML  = 'The optimal strategy is determined thanks to a recursive algorithm which goes through all possible games (enumeration of all games<br>with some &quot;equivalent games&quot; tricks for optimization).<br>The goal of this algorithm is to minimize the average number of attempts to find secret codes, all secret codes having the same weight<br>(i.e. same probability to be selected). In this algorithm, only the possible codes are considered at each stage of the game.<br>In some (very rare) cases, playing an impossible code may be better than playing the best possible code!<br>This could be called a &quot;useful mistake&quot;. This will thus result in the above number to be strictly positive (e.g. +0.10). If you get<br>such a number (voluntarily), you are really good!';"><i>Click here for more details on the optimal strategy...</i></div><br>
    
    <b>Game rules:</b><br>
    The goal of the game is to find out a secret code composed of N colors (duplicate colors are allowed).<br>
    The player makes successive attempts and has to find the secret code before the maximum number of attempts is reached.<br>
    At each attempt, the program will provide feedback by displaying from zero to N pegs next to the code played:<br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin:0">
    <li>a black peg indicates the existence of a correct color placed in a correct position,</li>
    <li>a white peg indicates the existence of a correct color placed in a wrong position.</li>
    </ul>
    Once this feedback has been provided, another attempt is made.<br>
    The game ends when the secret code is found, which means the player got N black pegs, or when the maximum number<br> 
    of attempts is reached, in which case the game is lost.<br>
